# Todo_List

1. **Creating a Todo List Component**: In React, you'd start by creating a TodoList component. This component will hold the state of all tasks and render them.

2. **Adding Tasks**: When the user inputs a task in the input field and clicks the submit button, an event handler is triggered. This event handler captures the value of the input field, let's say "taskName", and adds it to the list of tasks. The state is updated with this new task.

3. **Passing Tasks as Props**: Once the new task is added to the state of the TodoList component, the list of tasks is passed down to child components as props.

4. **Creating TodoItem Component**: Each task in the TodoList will be rendered as a TodoItem component. This component receives the individual task details (like task name, completion status, etc.) as props.

5. **Rendering Tasks**: Inside the TodoList component, you map through the list of tasks and render a TodoItem component for each task. This will display the task name along with two buttons: Edit and Remove.

6. **Edit Functionality**: When the user clicks the "Edit" button on a TodoItem, an edit event handler is triggered. This event handler may open a modal or change the state to allow the task to be edited inline. Once the task is edited and saved, the state is updated with the new task details.

7. **Remove Functionality**: When the user clicks the "Remove" button on a TodoItem, a remove event handler is triggered. This event handler removes the task from the list of tasks in the state of the TodoList component.

8. **Updating State**: After any modification (addition, editing, or removal of a task), the state of the TodoList component is updated. This triggers a re-render, and the changes are reflected in the UI.

9. **Receiving Props in TodoItem Component**: The TodoItem component receives props containing the task details. It renders the task name along with the Edit and Remove buttons.

10. **Handling Edit and Remove Actions**: Inside the TodoItem component, click handlers for Edit and Remove buttons are defined. These handlers might call functions passed down from the parent TodoList component, allowing it to modify the state accordingly.

11. **Updating UI**: Whenever a task is edited or removed, the UI is updated to reflect the changes. If a task is edited, its new details are displayed. If a task is removed, it is no longer displayed in the list.

12. **Completing Tasks**: If you want to add a feature to mark tasks as completed, you would add another button or checkbox to each TodoItem component. Clicking this button would toggle the completion status of the task in the state, updating the UI accordingly.
